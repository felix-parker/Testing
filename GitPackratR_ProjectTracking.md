>GitHub is like dropbox & googledoc
>GitHub will need to speak to local repo (file folder), may conflict with CQU permissions
>GitHub can use markdown (.md) with R code (.rmd) using rmarkdown package
>on base r call rmarkdown::render("xxx.Rmd")
>md files are priviledged on GitHub over eg. docx or pdf
>md can be viewed, r code viewed, and results viewed on GitHub without needing to download code & run it
>therefore, github can be the code-heavy backend and the readable front end
>plain r scripts can also be rendered as .md and viewed once pushed to GitHub
>need to decide which files we prefer to commit&track & what to leave out
>worddoc & spreadsheets wont be readable in GitHub>>.rmd, .md, .csv when rapid developing
>merge conflicts are best avoided rather than resolved
>push often!! first commit, push, pull; then branches & pull requests
