#**GitPackratR Project Tracking**

<br>*GitHub is like dropbox & googledoc
<br>*GitHub will need to speak to local repo (file folder), may conflict with CQU permissions
<br>*GitHub can use markdown (.md) with R code (.rmd) using rmarkdown package
<br>*on base r call rmarkdown::render("xxx.Rmd")
<br>*md files are priviledged on GitHub over eg. docx or pdf
<br>*md can be viewed, r code viewed, and results viewed on GitHub without needing to download code & run it
<br>*therefore, github can be the code-heavy backend and the readable front end
<br>*plain r scripts can also be rendered as .md and viewed once pushed to GitHub
<br>*need to decide which files we prefer to commit&track & what to leave out
<br>*worddoc & spreadsheets wont be readable in GitHub>>.rmd, .md, .csv when rapid developing
<br>*merge conflicts are best avoided rather than resolved
<br>*push often!! first commit, push, pull; then branches & pull requests
<br>**MAIN ISSUE:r studio link with github for established project**
